                    that allows you to send messages to other connecting people in the server <br>
                    but count on it, the collusion will occur as the message will broadcasting to all connections, <br>
                    so we designed a system to abstract each connection<br>
                    with it's shell,to avoid collusion we make a dynamic connection id for each connection<br>
                    that connects to the server in a specific shell so that <br>
                    the collusion will be unreachable.<br>
