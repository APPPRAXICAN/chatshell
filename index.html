                we use Ratchet websocket system and it a high level socket programming 
                that allows you to send messages to other connecting people in the server 
                but count on it, the collusion will occur as the message will broadcasting to all connections, 
                so we designed a system to abstract each connection
                with it's shell,to avoid collusion we make a dynamic connection id for each connection
                that connects to the server in a specific shell so that 
                the collusion will be unreachable.
